# React and TypeScript
Description
I created React And TypeScript as a way for me to learn React and TypeScript. I decided to share my notes online which is exactly what you're looking at here. I hope for this project to grow and be THE default source for React and TypeScript documentation.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
